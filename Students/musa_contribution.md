Learning Outcomes
=================
This is for the DevOps Class that was taught in [F.A.S.T University](https://www.nu.edu.pk/) as an elective. I took this course for getting a better understanding of how different organizations deliver applications and services at high velocity.

## Contribution Blogs I Have Written
### [How to Setup Hadoop 3.2.1 Single-Node Cluster on Ubuntu](https://medium.com/@mcheema2010/how-to-setup-hadoop-3-2-1-single-node-cluster-on-ubuntu-641fdc6c2b56)
Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to terabytes of data. In this Blog I have made instruction blog to install Hadoop. 


### [Hadoop Docker Installation](https://medium.com/@mcheema2010/hadoop-docker-installation-d3a6082aac71)
If you are running Hadoop in an environment where you may need mixed Java versions, then running it as a container could isolate the dependencies (in this case, Java) from the host system. Sometimes, it would get you a more easily reproducible artifact to move around and set up. In this Blog I have made instruction blog to install Hadoop using Docker.

### [Linkerd vs Istio](https://medium.com/@mcheema2010/linkerd-vs-istio-f0308c3d1061)
In this I examined Linkerd and Istio tools and evaluate them against various standards in this blog. As the service mesh has been a major advancement in the Kubernetes networking field in recent years.

## My Future Plan

```python

future = ['Implement Techniques Learnt in DevOps in FYP', 'MLOPs', 'Deployment of FYP on Cloud', 'Open Source Contribution', 'DevOps Seminar in FAST']

for i in future:
    next_semester(i) # To be done in next semester :)
```
